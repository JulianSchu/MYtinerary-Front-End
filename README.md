# MYtinerary - Front-End

MYtinerary was the last project from Ubiqum Code Camp. The project was supposed to create a SPA letting travellers collect and share their special itineraries. With this project, we were asked to use MERN framework, which are MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and Node.JS. Furthermore we were asked to create user stories and use Balsamiq wireframe to create scatches for our application.

The git repository here is only for the front-end part of the code.
