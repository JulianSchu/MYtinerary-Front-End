# MYtinerary - Front-End

MYtinerary was the last project from Ubiqum Code Camp. The project was supposed to create a simple CRUD app letting travellers collect and share their special itineraries. With this project, we were asked to use MERN framework, which are MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and Node.JS. Furthermore we were asked to create user stories and use Balsamiq wireframe to create scatches for our application. Both normal user login and google login under the MERN framework were also required.

The git repository here is only for the front-end part of the code.
